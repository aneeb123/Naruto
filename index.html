            <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki, the hero of the Hidden Leaf Village, one of the most popular characters in anime and manga, and - perhaps most importantly - Boruto’s dad; is incredibly strong within his franchise and by shonen protagonist standards in general. His rigorous training, mastery of a mystical fighting style, and command over Tailed Beast chakra allows him to battle even the strongest of enemies in the Naruto series. </p>

            <h1>Sasuke Uchiha</h1>
            <p>Sasuke Uchiha remains one of the most complicated and beloved characters in the Naruto franchise, even as a mentor to a new generation in the Boruto series. Part of the reason he's so beloved is that a lot of fans consider Naruto to be overpowered, and Sasuke is the only character who has developed along the same trajectory to be able to even come close to matching him in a fight. Of course, as adults, they're allies instead of enemies, but there was a time when all the audience wanted was to see the two face off.</p>

            <h1>Hinata Hyūga</h1>
            <p>The Naruto franchise faces some criticism for a lot of the most powerful skills being split among two main characters. Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha earned a lot of flak from fans for being too overpowered - even by anime and manga standards. Just because they hold the most powerful jutsu in the shinobi world doesn’t mean they can do everything. In fact, Naruto spent most of his youth training in very specialized skills. As a result, he doesn’t have the tactical know-how of Shikamaru Nara, the ruthlessness of Sasuke Uchiha, or the medical prowess of Sakura Haruno and Ino Yamanaka. He also doesn’t have access to those jutsu that only occur in specific bloodlines. The Uchiha, Yamanaka, Akimichi, Nara, Inuzuka, and Hyuga families all have jutsu that Naruto can’t even attempt to access.</p>

            <h1>Itachi Uchiha</h1>
            <p>If there’s one thing that makes Naruto stand above most other shonen anime and manga it’s the series’ fantastic and expansive pool of characters. While a lot of other shonen series tend to crumble under their own weight as they go on and introduce more and more characters, Naruto handles it’s growing cast perfectly. Every time a new character of note shows up they have a distinct design, their personality and motives are established right away, and then they get one or two cool moments before hanging around in the background as a supporting character or exiting the series.</p>

            <h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
            <p>What exactly makes someone a true fan? Most fans of any series like to think of themselves as real fans of the show/manga/character they support. The line that separates true fan from the casual fan is not clear. Lots of fans consider themselves true fans if they watch every episode or read every chapter of the series. Some find true fandom as unwavering support for the character they love. Ultimately, being a true fan is in the eye of the beholder. </p>

            <p>He was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he entrusted to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara Uchiha, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with the world, and he sought to replace it with a new one.</p>

            <h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>
            <p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.
